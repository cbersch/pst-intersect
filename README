The package pst-intersect computes the intersections between arbitrary
Postscript paths or Bézier curves using the Bézier clipping algorithm.

Installation
------------

The package is supplied in dtx format and as a pre-extracted zip file,
pst-intersect.tds.zip. The later is most convenient for most users:
simply unzip this in your local texmf directory and run texhash to
update the database of file locations. If you want to unpack the dtx
yourself you must run "tex pst-intersect.ins", to typeset the
documentation run "latex pst-intersect.dtx", or preferably use the
provided Makefile.

The package requires recent versions of pstricks, pst-node, and
pst-func.
